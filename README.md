<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a> Overview</h2>
A  retail company is looking to understand its customer’s purchasing behavior and demographic trends. The company has provided two datasets: purchase data (containing information about orders) and customer data
(containing customer demographic details). The goal is to derive actionable insights from these datasets.

<h2><a class = "anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

1. Which products contribute the most to revenue, and how can discounts and shipping costs be optimised?

2. Are there any patterns in customer demographics (age, income, and country) that influence purchasing behavior?
   
3. Is there a significant difference in income or purchasing habits between genders?

4. Can the shipping process be optimized by analysing shipping costs and durations? 

5. How strongly does customer income correlate with their purchasing behavior?

<h2><a class= "#research-factors"></a>Research Factors</h2>

Key Metrics Analysis: Analyse key performance and retention metrics such as length of service, average training score, awards won, previous year ratings, and KPIs met.

Retention Trends Analysis: Assess retention trends based on age, education, department, and training.

Predictive Insights: Based on the analysis, provide actionable recommendations to HR for improving employee retention and performance management strategies.

<h2><a class= "#key-findings"></a>Key Findings</h2>

**Workforce Overview**

- Employees are mostly in the early to mid-career range (20–40 years). 
- Distribution across departments and regions varies, highlighting operational concentration risks. 
- Recruitment channels influence performance outcomes, indicating differences in candidate quality.

**Performance Insights**
  
- High training scores, KPI achievement, and awards strongly correlate with better performance. 
- Consistent performers continue to excel year-over-year. 
- Departments with lower performance may need targeted interventions.
  
**Retention Trends Insights**

- High retention: Employees aged 30–40, award winners, and consistent KPI achievers. 
- Retention risk: Early-career employees (20–30), low KPI achievers, and employees in certain departments with shorter tenure. 
- Effective training and recognition directly improve retention.

**Employees with higher training scores and KPI achievement show longer retention**

**Award-winning employees consistently outperform peers** 

**Mid-career age groups (30–40) show the highest retention** 

**Certain departments have shorter service lengths, indicating engagement gaps** 

**Employees with lower previous year ratings are more likely to exit early**

<h2><a class= "#how-to-run-this-project"></a>How to Run this Project</h2>


<h2><a class= "#final-recommendations"></a>Final HR Recommendations</h2>

1. Increase targeted training programs for low-performing departments. 

2. Introduce recognition programs to improve motivation and retention. 

3. Focus retention strategies on early-career employees (20–30 age group). 

4. Use KPI performance as an early indicator for engagement interventions. 

5. Invest in continuous learning for employees with high potential but low ratings.

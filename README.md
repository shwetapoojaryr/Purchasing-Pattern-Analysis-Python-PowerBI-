# Analysing-Purchasing-Patterns-for-Strategic-Business-Insights-

one line summary

overview
A  retail company is looking to understand its customer’s purchasing behavior and demographic trends. The company has provided two datasets: purchase data (containing information about orders) and customer data
(containing customer demographic details). The goal is to derive actionable insights from these datasets.

Problem Statement:

The company wants to address the following business questions: 

1. Which products contribute the most to revenue, and how can discounts and shipping costs be optimised?

2. Are there any patterns in customer demographics (age, income, and country) that influence purchasing behavior?
   
3. Is there a significant difference in income or purchasing habits between genders?

4. Can the shipping process be optimized by analysing shipping costs and durations? 

5. How strongly does customer income correlate with their purchasing behavior?
